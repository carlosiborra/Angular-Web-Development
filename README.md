Hello world, this is intended to be an introduction to Angular and Typescript for all.<br>
The notes have been taken while I took a great Angular course on Udemy.

> ### _If you miss some information or code_, feel free to fork it.

> ### _**For viewing my notes**_ on the course, open the <code>Note.ipynb</code> file.
> There, you will find my summaries for TypeScript as well as for Angular.<br>
> On the other hand, if you want to take a deeper look at the course, visit the <code>code</code> folder.

Thank you!
